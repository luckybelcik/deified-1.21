If you are to port Deified to a different mod loader, you must NOT make any changes to the behaviour or appearance of any element without my consent. For example, you can not make an item look differently, or function differently, etc. Essentially, it will be the same mod, just ported to another mod loader.

However, you can add yourself to the credits as the person who ported to that mod loader.
