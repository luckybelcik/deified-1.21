# Deified.
**To elevate someone or something to the status of a god.**

Developed by luckybelcik and Dardemai 😁😁😁😃😃😃😃

Inspired by Terraria, Calamity Mod (for terraria), Calamity: Wrath of the Gods (calamity add-on), Mythology and Folklore (greek, roman, christian, slavic)

## **WARNING!**

It’s highly recommended to play this mod on a separate instance. **Deified** takes **bold** creative liberties, including altering game files, to craft its surreal atmosphere. While it won’t harm your PC, the outcome of your playthrough could potentially disrupt the Minecraft instance you’re using. Proceed with caution!



**Deified** introduces a wealth of new content, with a primary focus on a newly explorable dimension and _The Nexus_, which form the heart of the experience. Designed to delve into the complexities of human nature, it offers a distinctive role-play adventure that thrives on teamwork, alliances, as well as the darker aspects of greed, betrayal, and chaos.

While you _could_ consult the mod's wiki (if one even exists...), diving in blind is the ultimate way to experience it. Even with the wiki at your side, you’ll never be fully prepared for what lies ahead. **Deified** is packed with surprises, offering a highly personalized and unpredictable journey for every player. So, before transforming into a hardcore _Deified_ expert, let yourself enjoy the thrill of discovery firsthand.

**Important Note**: This mod shines in multiplayer! It’s all about dynamic player interactions—strategizing, scheming, and collaborating. In single-player, the experience might feel a bit underwhelming, as it’s truly built for the social chaos of multiplayer gameplay.

## **A note for server owners**

If you run into some problems (like crashes SPECIFICALLY because of my mods), please hit me up on discord (@luckybelcik). Don't worry about me being too busy to reply, that is NOT the case! I spent half my free time watching movies, please drag me back into work. :D

Also, if you are hosting a server with Deified, tell me! It kinda motivates me. A lot. Thanks!!

## **Porting and updates**

I will **NOT** be porting this mod to any other loader, I might update it to newer versions. Don't ask me to do these things. For every time I get asked to port or update to a newer minecraft version, I will delay updating by a day and block the asker INSTANTLY. I'm not kidding, I'll gladly be selfish and lazy.

If anyone else wants to port to other mod loaders, feel free to do it, just tell me that you're doing it.
